                        <p><span class="story__text-intro">How can I sum up 34 years</span> with Stephen in just a few minutes? </p>

                        <p>He was funny, smart, ambitious and had an unwavering faith in God. He dearly loved me, our family and his extended family. He loved people, he loved to talk. There were no short conversations with him.</p>

                        <p>Almost every day he would have something to say that would make me smile or laugh. It was fun living with someone who was so upbeat and excited about life. </p>

                        <p>He was smart. He was very well read especially on current events. He frequently brought a new perspective to even the most ordinary topics. He could converse with anybody about anything and thoroughly enjoyed doing so. He challenged me (in a good way) in many ways. He challenged my thinking, he challenged my faith, he challenged me professionally and at times he challenged my patience.</p>
                        
                        <p> 
                        He was ambitious, he had big dreams professionally and for our family. He was optimistic and rarely down. Whenever faced with challenges, he would never give up. He would work and work and work to find a solution. He was a planner. He had activities planned months and sometimes years in advance.</p>

                        <p>He had an unassuming and unwavering faith in God. When we would discuss spiritual matters that no one (this side of heaven) has an answer to he would say, “I can’t explain it all but if it’s in the Bible, then I believe it’s true.” He lived out his faith in very practical ways.</p>

                        <p>
                        He loved and cherished his family. He knew me completely and loved me unconditionally. He was extremely proud of our children and as the oldest of 6 kids he made time with his extended family a priority. He was always planning family activities and events. </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            When the coroner came early that Thursday morning and put him on the gurney she asked, ”Do you want to say good-bye to your husand now?” And I said “No!” I don't want to say good-bye and I will not say good-bye to him because he is still with us. There is a big part of him living in me, our children and each one of us. Whether you have spent 62 years knowing him like his mother, over 40 years knowing him like his brothers and sisters, 34 years of knowing him like myself or if you just met him last week, he has impacted each of our lives in some very meaningful ways.
                        </p>

                        <p>Our family will need to adapt because even though he is with us in spirit he is not with us physically and that we will greatly miss. So far, God has cared for us well. Through everyone here as well as many others we have been loved and supported with cards, meals, cleaning, money, flowers and most especially prayer. Lots and lots of prayer. We are eternally grateful. I want to thank each one of you for honoring Stephen. And I am confident God will continue to care for us as we navigate life without this wonderful, extraordinary man.</p>

                <article id="reflections-monica" class="story">
                    <h3 class="story__title">Monica</h3>
                    <div class="story__text">
                        <p><span class="story__text-intro">My father is definitely</span> a man who enjoyed giving advice and sharing his knowledge, whether the intended audience wanted it or not. In the case of my siblings and I; we never seemed as receptive as he might have liked. Maybe it was because we understood his methods, or what we might call tricks &mdash; and grew suspicious when his questions had obvious answers. But, maybe it was because it is all too easy to discount your parents as irrelevant when you are growing up.</p>

                        <p>I am sure all of us in this room remember my father’s fondness for stories and imparting wisdom. Yet, every so often, I remember  something he would say would stick with me &mdash; if only because it was not packaged in his usual fanfare. Wisdom like this tended to pop up in my mind &mdash; when I least expected it and usually when I needed it most.</p>

                        <p>One such instance was in high school. I was running around, rushing to this sport, or that extra curricular activity. This attribute, the constant striving and activity, I have been told I get from my father. In any case, I remember being extremely busy &mdash; dreaming about what I was going to do in my future, or considering just which prestigious university I anticipated attending. During this exciting time, I remember stating out loud that I did not understand why this perspective was at all unique. Why doesn’t everyone seemed as concerned to go to the best school, get the best job, and see just what the world will may reveal?</p>

                        <p>What my father said, perhaps off handedly, has stayed with me to this day. He said, “Monica, you do not yet know what it is to feel full.” To feel full. What I took that to mean was a sort of contentedness, but at the time I am sure I also thought of it as apathy.</p>

                        <p>But what the years have taught me is that a full life is not one that is optimized. It is not the person who has been to the most countries or has the most prestigious credentials. It is not the one that makes the most money. It is the one who takes pride and joy in each day and surrounds themselves with those who he loves.</p>

                        <p>And that is truly where my father excelled &mdash; having a full life. His joyfulness was unparalleled, his optimism relentless. He, more than anyone, I feel took every opportunity to engage with others &mdash; whether members of our family or strangers he would meet by chance. He lived life as a sort of celebration.</p>

                        <p>And yes, he was still striving, and definitely was a dreamer. In going through his notebooks, we have happened upon many plans for fleets of kayaks and fishing boats, or yurt villages he wanted to build in the backyard. But these dreams were not selfish attempts at self validation but a way that he could more easily bring his family into that fullness that he envisioned. To share with them the joy that he experienced fishing, crabbing or simply tending a fire in the back yard.</p>

                        <p>I wish I could tell my father that I was listening &mdash; that I was receptive, even if he could not tell. And that the highest achievement that I can picture or aspire to is an emulation of that fullness of which he spoke and embodied. Of taking pleasure and joy in each day.  That I should know the real from the temporal. What I hope, is that this wisdom will never fade from my memory, but become even more central in my own approach to life. I have some time still to decide whether that means yurt villages (probably not), or doing more of the hiking in the Pacific Northwest that I love, or just working with my sister to master his world-renowned ribs. What I do know, is that the deepest success would be, that at the end of my life, I would truly know what it is like to feel full.</p>

                    <div class="story__text">
                        <p><span class="story__text-intro">My father was a remarkable man</span>, full of life, energy, and overflowing with optimism. He loved his family fiercely and unwaveringly.</p>
                        <p>I have so many special memories with him, over the years, and while I would have loved to have a lifetime more of memories with him, I am incredibly grateful for the so many I have with him.</p>

                        <p>Memories like going camping in the San Juan Islands and seeing orca whales on our 16 foot ski boat &mdash; going treat-or-treating and then having apple cider and donuts by the outdoor fire pit on Halloween &mdash; having date nights at Stromboli’s and splitting seafood fettuccini &mdash; spending Christmas after Christmas opening presents one by one in front of the video camera &mdash; going on sleigh rides and seeing snow on Christmas Eve &mdash; previewing at Seattle Pacific University as a high schooler and later moving me into the dorms as a freshman &mdash; him walking me down the aisle and speaking at my wedding &mdash; helping load up my moving truck and driving it to Waco for Tom and I and eating Texas barbecue together when we got there &mdash; and countless conversations discussing and planning for my future.</p>

                        <p>And there are so many things that he taught me, so many things in life. Things like how to smoke incredible barbecue ribs, how to catch &mdash; and efficiency kill crab &mdash; how to effectively brine and cook a turkey, that homemade molded cranberry sauce is a million times better than the stuff that comes in a can, how to start a campfire and wait for the perfect coals to roast marshmallows, and how to catch salmon and cook it on a cedar plank.</p>

                        <p>He taught me that excellence is worth pursuing &mdash; that it can be good to plan into the future &mdash; that being self-employed can give me the flexibility and freedom to spend more time with my family &mdash; that I am capable and have the ability to succeed in just about anything I want to do, that family is important &mdash; that traditions are beautiful and enjoyable whether we create themselves ourselves or they just evolve on their own over the years &mdash; that children are precious &mdash; that family memories are important to create and preserve &mdash; and that classic family stories need to be told and retold.</p>

                        <p>My father was a gifted storyteller and always had the best stories to tell about his life, us kids, and his family and friends. As we embark on this next phase of life without him, I want to continue hearing and telling and retelling stories about my father &mdash; about his life, his likes and dislikes, his best qualities, and all of his quirks. I would ask all of you to think on and share with us &mdash; over and over &mdash; all of those memories you have with him, and to help remind me to tell stories about him, about my growing up, and about my own life.</p>

                        <p>I love him so very much and will miss him dearly for the rest of my life, but remain eternally grateful for the gift of his presence in my life for these past 30 years.</p>

                    <p>One of Stephen’s passions was boating. Over the years we’ve enjoyed a small ski boat, a 25 ft fishing boat and did a timeshare on a 35 ft trawler. A few weeks before he died we took a sailing class together. The weather was awful but we both had a great time. I am so glad we were able to share one more boating experience.</p>

                    <p>In May I had the honor of watching my son-in-law Tom graduate with his Ph.D from Baylor University in Waco, TX. Shortly after that I proudly watched as Monica received her Master’s in Public Administration in International Development from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. </p> 

                    <p>Following Stephen’s death I moved to West Seattle and now live with my sister-in-law. We have found a great church and are meeting some new friends.  </p>

                    <p>In August I flew to Washington DC to help Monica move into her new condo. In September I flew to Boise to attend a niece’s wedding. Back to DC for Thanksgiving with all the kids and their significant others. And in December to Boise again to celebrate my mother-in-law’s birthday.</p>

                    <p>The kids and I are spending Christmas this year at Discovery Bay near Pt. Townsend, WA (Thanks PJ) where we hope to do some hiking and snowshoeing.</p>

                    <p>Once again I want to thank you all so very much for all the prayers and support you’ve showered on me and my family this past year.</p>

Tired of the snowy, Boston winters, she decided to skip town and move back to Philadelphia. Having enough of grad school altogether, she snatched up her Masters' degrees from Harvard and UPenn (Wharton), and decided to move on to bigger and better things in Washington D.C. After a long pursuit, she finally took the plunge and committed to the position with Deloitte Consulting that she had been promising to take for the past two years. She and Deloitte have decided to purchase their very first home in the only place in the country whose local officials are not trusted to govern themselves. Fortunately enough, however, Deloitte has made good on its promise to show her the world &mdash; her first project took her to Tanzania and she is due to visit Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Japan, Uganda, and Kenya on Deloitte’s dime in the coming year. It’s Matthew, Monica’s actual boyfriend, who might be getting tired of her employer determining their vacation plans. </p>

                        <p><span class="story__text-intro">Grace</span> (Stephanie) is in her third and final year of her Master’s degree and is completing her internship at the Portland State University Community Counseling Clinic where she also holds a graduate assistant position as the clinic coordinator. This means she spends over 40 hours per week at the clinic between her two positions in addition to taking classes. She is looking forward to graduating in June and beginning the first year of in their marriage in which neither she nor Tom are in graduate school.</p>

                        <p>This year Grace and Tom took a trip to New York to attend a friend’s wedding, complete a summer course for her program, and see Micah and his girlfriend Monica. They also celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary with a trip to Leavenworth, WA, which they enjoyed despite the extensive wildfires in the area and the smoke-filled air on their hike in the Enchantments.</p>

                        <p>This coming year, Grace looks forward to finishing her degree, moving back to Seattle, and finally living full-time in the same state as her husband again. </p>

                        <p><span class="story__text-intro">Tom</span> graduated with his PhD in social psychology in May and returned to Waco one last time for graduation. Less than a month after walking at his own graduation, Tom donned his academic regalia again to participate in Seattle Pacific University’s graduation ceremony &mdash; this time as a professor! This has been the first year of teaching in person at <span class="small-cap">SPU</span>, which involves commuting back and forth between Portland and Seattle each week. Fortunately, <span class="small-cap">SPU</span> and <span class="small-cap">PSU</span> have the same academic schedule, meaning Tom and Grace have the same school breaks to spend together. Tom is thoroughly enjoying teaching, mentoring students, and conducting his research and looks forward to making the permanent move back to Seattle this coming year.</p>
